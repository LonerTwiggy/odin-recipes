    <h1><em>A New Year's Day traditional meal, anytime!</em></h1>

    <p>This meal, traditionally eaten on New Year's Day to bring good luck throughout the coming year,
        can now be made quickly and easily any time of year! Tender, juicy pork mixes with flavor-packed 
        sauerkraut and onions to create a warming, filling, flavorful meal with few ingredients and in 
        less than 2 hours!</p>
    
    <h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
 
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 lb. Pork Loin Roast, cut into 2-3 inch chunks</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>16 oz. Sauerkraut, drained</li>
        <li>1 cup Apple Juice</li>
        <li>1 large Yellow Onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 Apple, sliced *optional*</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Directions:</strong></h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Cut pork roast into 2-3 inch large chunks. Liberally season chunks on all sides with Salt and Pepper.</li>
        <li>Set the Instant Pot to "Saute." Once hot, add olive oil, and sear pork loin chunks on all sides.</li>
        <li>Cancel the Saute function. Pour apple juice into the pot. Add the sliced onions, garlic, and apple slices (optional).
             Top with 3/4s of the sauerkraut.
        </li>
        <li>Close and lock Instant Pot lid, make sure vent is turned to "Sealed."</li>
        <li>Choose the "Manual" setting on the Instant Pot, and cook for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the cook time has elapsed, allow pressure to release naturally for at least 15 minutes. Then 
            quick release by turning the vent to "venting."</li>
        <li>Stir, shredding the pork and mixing with the sauerkraut.</li>
        <li>Serve pork with juices over noodles or mashed potatoes if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><strong>Notes:</strong></h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Stock can be used in place of the Apple Juice, but I find the sweetness of the Apple Juice 
            balances out the tartness of the sauerkraut. If using the chicken stock, you may want to add 1-2 Tablespoons 
            of brown sugar to balance out the flavors.
        </li>
        <li>Garlic is optional, as it's not a part of a traditional pork and kraut recipe.</li>
    </ul>
