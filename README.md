bare bones recipes website - html lesson
This current project is part of The Odin Project's "Foundations" lesson. In this project and it's related commits, I will have demonstrated the ability to use certain HTML tags, including a basic HTML boilerplate, headers, img tags, unordered and ordered list tags, and anchor tags that demonstrate relative linking.
